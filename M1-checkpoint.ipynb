       "       \"Petroleum engineers' jobs typically involve research and production of natural gas and crude oil. More specifically, their job is to apply their knowledge of oil and gas, and how these hydrocarbons behave at a high pressure, in order to estimate the recoverable volume of the hydrocarbons, and maximize the recovery of the resources from subsurface reservoirs.There are several types of petroleum engineering jobs: reservoir engineering, drilling engineering, and production engineering jobs.Reservoir engineers are in charge of tasks related to well placement, oil recovery, and production rates, and they work to improve the production of oil and gas. Their job is to apply their knowledge of how oil and gas flow through rocks and what forces are involved in order to forecast the performance of reservoirs, set up well-drainage patterns, and improve the overall production efficiency.Drilling engineers deal with the technical tasks of drilling production and injection wells. They design drilling techniques, choose safety and casing equipment and decide on the direction of the operations.Production engineers evaluate lift methods, choose the equipment used to separate oil, water and natural gas, and are in charge of managing the interface between the reservoir and the well. Their job typically begins after the well has been completed. They manage and measure the fluids, design storage systems, and supply pipeline companies with oil and gas.Petroleum geology is another subdiscipline in the field of petroleum engineering, one that deals with analysis of subsurface structures for the purpose of finding hydrocarbons.\",\n",
